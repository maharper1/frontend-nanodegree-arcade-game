Splat!
===============================

Splat! will load when you open the index.html file. You will see a grid composed of grassy areas, stone pavement, and water. The goal of the game is to move the player from his starting location to the water area without colliding with an enemy (bug). The bugs move at random speeds and always enter from the left and move to the right.

To move the player, use the arrow keys on the keyboard; right arrow to move right, and so on. 

You start the game with five lives. Each time you reach the water, you are given a new life (up to 11 total). Each time you collide with an enemy, you lose a life. If you lose all of your lives, the game will restart.

The game starts with five bugs moving at a relatively slow speed. You may change the number of bugs and their speed using options accessed via the "Game Options" button.

Enjoy!
